					<h3>Aims and Objective of the BNS (or the New IPC)</h3>
				</button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p style="font-size:16px;font-weight:400 !important;">
						The current criminal laws are outdated and are remnants of the colonial era, which aimed to oppress Indians rather than serve justice. Therefore, the primary objective behind the move was to cast away the shadow of the colonial era from the Independent India. Accordingly, an attempt was made to remove the colonial imprint of the IPC, CrPC, and the Evidence Act and replace it with a truly Indian legal framework.<br><br>
						The IPC, for most of its part, lacked participation from the Indian populace and imposed foreign ideas and values, and over time the laws became more complex over the time. Social norms and values, like, gender neutrality, are also nowhere to be seen in the old law.
						<br>
						The BNS also aims to implement the changes as suggested and mandated by the Supreme Court judgments and to accommodate changing social perceptions.
